# Fuel Goes Here

If a recipe is added that uses a fuel like coal as an ingredient in a furnace, shift clicking a stack of coal will put it in the input slot instead of the fuel slot.

This mod changes the behavior so the fuel slot is always filled first before filling the input slot.

By default, the mod only changes things for coal and charcoal.
You can add more fuels by adding them to the item tag `fuelgoeshere:forced_fuels`
